Abstract: _Exact explicit solutions are given for a one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation with a particular potential form involving hyperbolic functions. This potential contains four arbitrary parameters that can be chosen so that the potential is bistable. The solutions also contain parameters that can be chosen so that the initial distribution is approximately Gaussian, centered either at the unstable potential maximum or in the neighborhood of the secondary minimum. The use of the solutions to approximate solutions for other potentials is considered._
